Features
•	The variant is compatible with both game modes, future versions will have interchangeability between additional variants and modes.
•	The project is designed to allow flexibility in creating alterations on the core gameplay.  
•	If you feel inclined to create your own custom gameplay, all logic for Conway Chess can be found in the Mod Folder as example code.

The project currently only supports local play, and no check detection.  Assume you have won if you take an enemy king.
